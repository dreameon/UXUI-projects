* All buttons have been implemented with a toggle-like view (only one item will be selected at a time) 
* Buttons for the stroke style selection have a default set to them already (thinnest and without dashes)
* If canvas was newly loaded/created/saved and no edits have been made to the drawing since then, user should not be prompted to save when attempting to create a new drawing, load a drawing, or quit.
